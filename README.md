# Hey there, I'm Shivam Thakur! 🚀

## **The Origin Story**

Just a coder by day, secret superhero by night 🦸‍♂️. I harness the power of code to craft innovative solutions and battle bugs to save the digital world. When I'm not coding, you can find me mastering the ancient art of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) or seeking wisdom on Frameworks.

### **Powers and Abilities**

- 🔭 **Daylight Coder**: Crafting code during sunlight to bring ideas to life.
- 🌙 **Nighttime Bug Hunter**: Battling bugs and saving the digital world when the moon shines.
- 🌱 **DSA Mastery**: Currently honing my skills in DSA to optimize code and solve complex problems.
- 👯 **Teamwork**: Looking to join forces with fellow tech avengers to collaborate on projects.
- 🤔 **Knowledge Seeker**: Seeking wisdom on Frameworks to expand my skillset.
- 💬 **.NET Expert**: Got questions about .NET? I've got answers (and memes).
- 📫 **Contact Info**: Send a bat signal (or just an email) to shivamthakur0776@gmail.com.

### **Personal Stats**

- Pronouns: He/Him (but during full moons, I'm "Your Highness") 😄
- Fun fact: I can type 100 words per minute, but only in the presence of pizza ⚡
